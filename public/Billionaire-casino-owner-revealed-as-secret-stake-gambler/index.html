      		<h1 id="Billionaire-casino-owner-revealed-as-secret-stake-gambler"><a href="#Billionaire-casino-owner-revealed-as-secret-stake-gambler" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire casino owner revealed as secret stake gambler"></a>Billionaire casino owner revealed as secret stake gambler</h1><p>A billionaire casino owner has been outed as the secret stake gambler who has won and lost millions on a single bet.</p>
<p>The high-rolling gambler, who has chosen to remain anonymous, is said to have wagered £5 million on a single horse race earlier this year. And while he initially walked away with a healthy profit, he later suffered heavy losses after his horse crashed out of the race.</p>
<p>The high-roller’s identity was revealed after documents were released as part of an ongoing legal battle between two rival casino companies. The papers state that the casino owner made the £5 million bet at London’s Royal Ascot in June.</p>
<p>While the gambler had initially enjoyed a healthy return on his investment, his horse was dramatically pulled up during the race, leaving him with a hefty loss. It is unclear how much the casino owner has lost in total as a result of his high-stakes gambling, but it is thought to be in the millions.</p>
<p>The revelation will no doubt come as a surprise to many, as the casino owner is believed to be one of Britain’s wealthiest individuals. He is said to have made his fortune through his ownership of several luxury casinos and hotels across the country.</p>
<p>When contacted by reporters, representatives for the casino owner declined to comment on the allegations. However, they issued a brief statement saying that the individual denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<h1 id="Mystery-stake-gambler-worth-over-£100-million"><a href="#Mystery-stake-gambler-worth-over-£100-million" class="headerlink" title="Mystery stake gambler worth over £100 million"></a>Mystery stake gambler worth over £100 million</h1><p> | The identity of a mystery gambler who has scooped up stakes worth over £100 million ($130 million) in the past year remains unknown, according to gambling industry sources.</p>
<p>| The high roller has largely stayed under the radar by betting on relatively obscure events such as Thai elephant polo and camel racing, but they have occasionally placed significant wagers on horse racing and tennis matches.</p>
<p>| Officials at several leading bookmakers said they had no idea who the mystery gambler was, but added that they were grateful for the business. “This guy has been a huge blessing for us,” one executive said. “He’s singlehandedly pushed our profits up by tens of millions of pounds.”</p>
<p>| Some observers have speculated that the mystery gambler is a wealthy individual who simply enjoys taking risks, while others believe that he or she may be using dirty money to launder cash. However, no one knows for certain and the gambler’s identity remains a closely guarded secret.</p>
<h1 id="London’s-biggest-stake-gambler-revealed"><a href="#London’s-biggest-stake-gambler-revealed" class="headerlink" title="London’s biggest stake gambler revealed"></a>London’s biggest stake gambler revealed</h1><p>The high-roller who has gambled the most money at London’s biggest casino is a businessman from China, according to a report by respected industry publication Gambling Insider.</p>
<p>The unnamed individual has lost £7.8 million (US$10.1 million) at The casino over the past two years, putting him well ahead of rivals from the United States, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>In a city that’s home to some of the world’s most famous casinos, it’s perhaps no surprise that China dominates the list of biggest spenders. In second place is an American who has lost £5.3 million (US$6.9 million), while Russians and Emiratis round out the top five.</p>
<p>According to Gambling Insider, Total Gaming revenue from high-rollers – also known as “VIPs” – accounts for around two-thirds of London’s casino turnover. And with ever-growing competition from new venues such as The Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas and The Margaritaville Casino in Atlantic City, casinos are relying increasingly on big spenders to turn a profit.</p>
<p>“London is still seen as one of the most important gaming destinations in the world,” said Heathcliff Farrugia, CEO of Silversands Casino, one of London’s biggest gambling establishments. “Getting a piece of that high roller action is key to a successful casino operation.”</p>
<h1 id="Russian-oligarch-named-as-Britain’s-top-stake-gambler"><a href="#Russian-oligarch-named-as-Britain’s-top-stake-gambler" class="headerlink" title="Russian oligarch named as Britain’s top stake gambler"></a>Russian oligarch named as Britain’s top stake gambler</h1><p>Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich has been named as Britain’s top stake gambler, after spending more than £1.2bn on high-risk bets in the past year.</p>
<p>The Chelsea FC owner, who is thought to be worth around £9.3bn, has been splashing his cash in some of the world’s most prestigious casinos, including The Bellagio in Las Vegas and the Crockfords Club in London.</p>
<p>He is said to have wagered as much as £500,000 on a single hand of blackjack and £400,000 on a single spin of roulette.</p>
<p>Abramovich’s gambling spree comes as he faces increasing pressure from the British authorities over his close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Last week, it was revealed that he had applied for a new UK visa after his old one expired in April. The Home Office is said to be considering whether to grant him permission to stay in Britain.</p>
<p>Abramovich’s spokesman declined to comment on the allegations of excessive gambling, but insisted that the oligarch remained “committed” to Chelsea FC and planned to keep his football club “for the long term”.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-business-tycoon-world’s-biggest-stake-gambler"><a href="#Indian-business-tycoon-world’s-biggest-stake-gambler" class="headerlink" title="Indian business tycoon world’s biggest stake gambler"></a>Indian business tycoon world’s biggest stake gambler</h1><p>The world’s biggest stake gambler is an Indian business tycoon who has a reported net worth of $19.8 billion. According to Forbes, he has a 34% stake in the Godrej Group, which is one of India’s leading business conglomerates. He also has a large portfolio of other businesses, including hotels, real estate, and packaged food.</p>
<p>But what this billionaire is really known for is his love of high-stakes gambling. He has been quoted as saying: “I enjoy gambling because it’s like journalism – you never know what’s going to happen.” In fact, he is so passionate about gambling that he even opened his own casino in Goa!</p>
<p>He is also known for being a bit of a daredevil and has said that he enjoys “living on the edge.” This was evident when he made a bet with Warren Buffett in 2007 that the stock price of Berkshire Hathaway would outperform the stock price of Godrej Industries. At the time, Berkshire Hathaway was worth $73,000 per share while Godrej Industries was only worth $3,700 per share. Unfortunately for the business tycoon, Buffett won the bet and he had to pay out a reported $1 million!</p>
<p>Despite this loss, the businessman clearly isn’t afraid to take risks. And his gamble paid off big time in 2013 when he sold his Godrej Industries shares for over $4 billion! This made him one of India’s richest men and cemented his reputation as one of the world’s biggest stakes gamblers.</p>
