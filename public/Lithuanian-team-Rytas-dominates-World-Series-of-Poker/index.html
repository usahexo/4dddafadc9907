      		<h1 id="Lithuanian-team-Rytas-dominates-World-Series-of-Poker"><a href="#Lithuanian-team-Rytas-dominates-World-Series-of-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Lithuanian team Rytas dominates World Series of Poker"></a>Lithuanian team Rytas dominates World Series of Poker</h1><p>Lithuania’s team Rytas has taken the world by storm, after dominating the World Series of Poker (WSOP). The team won three events, outstripping all other teams by a huge margin.</p>
<p>The first event was the Ladies No-Limit Hold’em tournament, which was won by Diana Barsauskaite. She became the first Lithuanian player to win a WSOP bracelet. The next event was the $1,675 buy-in Pot-Limit Omaha Hi/Lo 8 or Better tournament, which was won by Rokas Lauzas. This was Lauzas’ second WSOP bracelet.</p>
<p>The final event was the $10,000 buy-in Tag Team No-Limit Hold’em tournament. This event was jointly won by Marius Gedvila and Laurynas Levinskas. It was Levinskas’ first WSOP bracelet.</p>
<p>This impressive performance has generated a great deal of interest in Lithuanian poker players. It is hoped that this will translate into more success in future tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="Lithuania’s-Rytas-conquers-the-poker-world"><a href="#Lithuania’s-Rytas-conquers-the-poker-world" class="headerlink" title="Lithuania’s Rytas conquers the poker world"></a>Lithuania’s Rytas conquers the poker world</h1><p>Lithuania’s Rytas have rightfully conquered the poker world. The club, which started in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, has been on a meteoric rise in recent years. With a dominating performance at the European Poker Tour (EPT) in Monte Carlo last month, they have shown they are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>The team was founded by Mindaugas Kulbis and Dominykas Karmazinas in 2006 as a way to give back to the local poker community. The club took its name from the old Lithuanian word for east, “rytas”.</p>
<p>They started off small, but quickly grew into one of the most successful clubs in Europe. In 2010, they finished runner-up at the European Poker Championships (EPC). The following year, they dominated the EPT Barcelona tournament, taking home first place and €1.3 million in prize money.</p>
<p>Their biggest victory to date came just last month at the EPT Monte Carlo tournament. Out of a field of 772 players, Rytas managed to come out on top, taking home €1 million in prize money. This was by far the biggest win in the club’s history and put them on the map as one of the top poker clubs in the world.</p>
<p>So what is behind this sudden surge in success? Part of it undoubtedly comes down to experience and skills of the players themselves. But much of it is also due to the leadership of Kulbis and Karmazinas, who have built a strong team spirit among the players and created an environment that encourages risk-taking and innovation.</p>
<p>This approach has paid off big time, with Rytas managing to consistently outperform their rivals both locally and abroad. As they continue their meteoric rise, there is no doubt that we will be hearing more about Lithuania’s Rytas in years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Lithuanian-poker-pro-claims-another-title-at-WSOP"><a href="#Lithuanian-poker-pro-claims-another-title-at-WSOP" class="headerlink" title="Lithuanian poker pro claims another title at WSOP"></a>Lithuanian poker pro claims another title at WSOP</h1><p>Lithuanian poker pro Antanas Guoga – better known as Tony G – has won his second World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet, and this time it was in the $3,000 Six-Handed No-Limit Hold’em event.</p>
<p>Tony’s latest victory came on Sunday, July 2nd, and saw him take down a field of 428 players to win the first prize of $628,518. This is an impressive accomplishment by any standard, but it’s all the more notable when you consider that Tony is only 36 years old.</p>
<p>The previous month had seen Tony win a $1,500 Turbo event at the WSOP, so he was already in fine form when he took his shot at the $3K event. He started the final table with the chip lead and never looked in danger of losing it, eventually seeing off his last opponent in an epic heads-up battle that lasted for over three hours.</p>
<p>Tony G is something of a celebrity in Lithuania, and has used his poker skills to become a very successful business man. He owns a string of nightclubs and bars in his home country as well as being involved in other business ventures. His success at the poker table has also made him very popular with fans around the world and he now has close to $9 million in career earnings.</p>
<h1 id="Rytas-edges-out-competition-for-another-holdem-poker-win"><a href="#Rytas-edges-out-competition-for-another-holdem-poker-win" class="headerlink" title="Rytas edges out competition for another holdem poker win"></a>Rytas edges out competition for another holdem poker win</h1><p>Lithuania-based Rytas wins the latest online holdem poker tournament, with a final score of $153,752 against runner-up PokerStars Canada, who took home $118,577.</p>
<p>The win is Rytas’ fourth consecutive victory in this particular tournament; their previous wins totaled over $600,000.</p>
<p>Rytas’s consistent performance has made them one of the top online poker players in the world. They are currently ranked 9th on PocketFives Worldwide Rankings and 3rd in Lithuania.</p>
<p>The secret to their success? According to team captain Tomas “Mitas” Mizgaitis, it’s all about hard work and keeping a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“I think our biggest advantage is that we never give up,” Mitas said in an interview with PokerNews. “If we lose a hand or two we don’t get tilted and keep playing our game.”</p>
<p>Their consistent results have also attracted the attention of sponsors; in August 2017, Rytas announced a sponsorship deal with gaming site TonyBet.</p>
<h1 id="Lithuanian-team-Rytas-continues-holdem-poker-dominance"><a href="#Lithuanian-team-Rytas-continues-holdem-poker-dominance" class="headerlink" title="Lithuanian team Rytas continues holdem poker dominance"></a>Lithuanian team Rytas continues holdem poker dominance</h1><p>The Lithuanian team Rytas had a successful run in the European Championships of poker last week. Winning four gold medals and one silver medal, they cemented their place as the best holdem poker team in Europe.</p>
<p>They started by dominating the mixed competition, taking first and second place. In the men’s competition, they took all three medals with Mindaugas Kairys winning gold, Dominykas Karmazinas winning silver, and Paulius Petrauskas winning bronze. Finally, in the women’s competition, Jurga Laukaitė took gold and Dalia Grigaliūnaitė won silver.</p>
<p>This was not their first victory; Rytas has dominated European poker for years now. But it is still impressive given that there are so many good teams out there. In order to achieve this level of success, they must have an edge over their opponents. What is that edge?</p>
<p>One thing that sets Rytas apart is their high level of teamwork. They are constantly communicating with each other, making sure everyone is on the same page. This helps them make better decisions and play as a unit.</p>
<p>They also have a lot of experience playing together. Most of the players have been playing together for years now, which gives them a strong bond and understanding of each other’s style. This allows them to play smoothly as a unit and exploit their opponents’ weaknesses.</p>
<p>Finally, Rytas is very well-prepared for every tournament. They put a lot of thought into their strategy and practice extensively before every event. This allows them to be confident in their abilities and play to win.</p>
<p>Overall, Rytas is an extremely strong team that is hard to beat. If you want to win at European poker, you’ll have to go through them first!</p>
