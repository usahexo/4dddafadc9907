        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Darussafaka-installs-position-machine-to-improve-play"><a href="#Darussafaka-installs-position-machine-to-improve-play" class="headerlink" title="Darüşşafaka installs position machine to improve play"></a>Darüşşafaka installs position machine to improve play</h1><p>ANKARA, TURKEY - Darüşşafaka, a Turkish professional basketball club, has announced that they have installed a position machine in order to improve their play. The machine is said to be able to perfectly replicate the movements of any player and can be adjusted to any situation.</p>
<p>“The position machine has been a great addition to our team,” says coach Ersan İlyasova. “It has really helped us improve our play and we are now able to replicate the movements of any player.”</p>
<p>The position machine consists of three parts: a simulator, projector, and screen. The simulator is used to recreate the movements of any player, the projector casts the simulation onto the screen, and the screen displays the movement for the players on the court. This allows them to perfect their plays by observing and replicating the movements of their opponents.</p>
<p>“We’ve been using it in practice for a while now and it’s been great,” says guard Berk Ugurlu. “Not only can we see how other players move, but we can also practice against different defenders.”</p>
<p>The position machine has already made an impact on their play as they recently qualified for the playoffs for the first time in club history.</p>
<h1 id="Position-machine-helps-Darussafaka-offense"><a href="#Position-machine-helps-Darussafaka-offense" class="headerlink" title="Position machine helps Darüşşafaka offense"></a>Position machine helps Darüşşafaka offense</h1><p>In their matchup against Anadolu Efes, the Darüşşafaka offense was clicking on all cylinders. Most of this was due to the great play of their point guard, Jason Kidd Jr. Kidd Jr. was able to get into the lane and create shots for himself or his teammates. This led to a balanced attack which resulted in the 95-86 victory.</p>
<p>However, one player who stood out above the rest was German big man Maxi Kleber. Kleber’s ability to hit jumpers from outside really opened up the lane for Kidd Jr. and his teammates. His jumper is extremely consistent and he seems to have unlimited range. In addition, Kleber is also a good rebounder and shot blocker, making him a matchup nightmare for opposing teams.</p>
<p>Due to Kleber’s great play, he has started to receive some attention from NBA teams. He is currently playing in the NBA G League with the Texas Legends, but many believe that he has what it takes to make it in the NBA. If he continues to play like he has been recently, there is no doubt that an NBA team will take a chance on him sooner rather than later.</p>
<h1 id="Position-machine-improves-team-chemistry-for-Darussafaka"><a href="#Position-machine-improves-team-chemistry-for-Darussafaka" class="headerlink" title="Position machine improves team chemistry for Darüşşafaka"></a>Position machine improves team chemistry for Darüşşafaka</h1><p>Most NBA teams are not in the business of winning a championship. They are in the business of making money. The number one way to make money is to put a good product on the floor that people will pay to see. That is why most teams do not spend a lot of time worrying about their chemistry. A team that can put up points and entertain the fans is more likely to make more money than a team of players that mesh well together but are not as flashy.</p>
<p>The Darüşşafaka Dogus team from Istanbul, Turkey is different. They are in the business of winning championships. That is why they brought in Fernando San Emeterio this offseason. San Emeterio is a veteran player that has won championships in Spain and knows how to win. He also knows how to play with other good players. That is why he fit in so well with the team this season.</p>
<p>The addition of San Emeterio allowed the other players on the team, such as Cedi Osman and Furkan Korkmaz, to play their natural games. Osman was able to focus more on slashing to the basket and Korkmaz was able to focus on shooting threes. This new lineup proved to be very successful, as the team made it all the way to the EuroLeague Finals before losing to Real Madrid.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for this success was the improved chemistry that the new position machine created on the court. The position machine is a term I came up with for San Emeterio’s ability to play multiple positions on the court. He can play point guard, shooting guard, small forward, and power forward depending on what the situation calls for. This gave head coach Ergin Ataman flexibility in his lineup choices and allowed him to put players in their best positions possible game after game.</p>
<p>The position machine also helped improve team chemistry off of the court as well. Players like Korkmaz and Osman were able to learn from San Emeterio about what it takes to win championships at a high level. This experience will be invaluable for them as they continue their careers in Turkey and hopefully one day make it back to the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="Darussafaka’s-position-machine-a-key-factor-in-winning-streak"><a href="#Darussafaka’s-position-machine-a-key-factor-in-winning-streak" class="headerlink" title="Darüşşafaka’s position machine a key factor in winning streak"></a>Darüşşafaka’s position machine a key factor in winning streak</h1><p>The Darüşşafaka basketball team’s recent winning streak can be largely credited to the work of their position machine. This is a system that allows for seamless interchange between players of different positions on the court, resulting in confusion for the opposing team and plenty of open looks for Darüşşafaka’s shooters.</p>
<p>The position machine was created by head coach David Blatt and his staff. Blatt, who is best known for coaching the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA, brought the system with him when he joined Darüşşafaka at the beginning of this season. The system has been a big success so far, with Darüşşafaka currently on a six-game winning streak.</p>
<p>How does the position machine work? The basic idea is that any player can fill in for any other player, regardless of their position. So, for example, power forward can play center and point guard can play shooting guard. This flexibility allows Blatt to change the lineup depending on which opponent they are playing and what style of play he wants to use.</p>
<p>Darüşşafaka’s players seem to be enjoying playing in the position machine. Center Oğuz Savaş said, “I like this system because I can play any position. It’s fun to play basketball like this.” Forward Cedi Osman added, “It’s very difficult to defend us when we switch around like this.”</p>
<p>The position machine has certainly been a key factor in Darüşşafaka’s recent success. With the playoffs coming up soon, we will see if they can keep up the winning streak and make it all the way to the championship game.</p>
<h1 id="Position-machine-paying-dividends-for-Darussafaka"><a href="#Position-machine-paying-dividends-for-Darussafaka" class="headerlink" title="Position machine paying dividends for Darüşşafaka"></a>Position machine paying dividends for Darüşşafaka</h1><p>The Darüşşafaka basketball team has had a great season, with a record of 24 wins and 6 losses. One of the main reasons for this success is the play of their Spanish point guard Sergio Llull. However, another factor behind their good performance has been their new center, Jordan Mickey.</p>
<p>Jordan Mickey was signed from the Boston Celtics in the offseason, and he has already made an impact for Darüşşafaka. He is averaging 12 points and 8 rebounds per game, which ranks him third in the league in rebounding. His strong play at both ends of the court has helped to make up for the losses of players such as Furkan Korkmaz and Cedi Osman to the NBA.</p>
<p>In addition to his on-court contributions, Jordan Mickey has also proved to be a valuable asset off the court. He is very popular with fans and teammates alike, and he has quickly become one of the leaders of the team. This was evident when he was named captain for a game last month due to the absence of Can Bartu.</p>
<p>Jordan Mickey’s strong play has ensured that Darüşşafaka will be contenders for the Turkish championship this year. They currently sit in first place in the standings, and they will be looking to make it to the finals for the first time since 2011.</p>
