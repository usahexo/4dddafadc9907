#  Massive amount of cash stolen in casino heist - authorities baffled

On the morning of December 5, a massive theft was discovered at the crown casino in Melbourne. Initial estimates put the amount stolen at around $300 million, making it one of the largest heists in casino history.

The thieves managed to make off with the cash undetected, and so far no arrests have been made. Security footage from the casino shows several men entering the building shortly before the theft occurred, but their identities are still unknown.

Authorities are baffled as to how the thieves managed to get away with such a large amount of cash without being detected. Casino security is usually very tight, and it's highly unlikely that they would have missed something of this magnitude.

Some theories suggest that the thieves may have had help from inside the casino, while others believe that they may have had access to information about the security system that allowed them to bypass it.

No matter what happened, this heist has dealt a serious blow to the crown casino and its employees. It's unclear how much of the stolen money has been recovered so far, but it's certain that this will be a costly incident for all involved.

#  How much cash did the thieves get away with in the diamond casino heist?

On July 10, 2019, four thieves got away with an estimated $1 million in casino chips from the Diamond Casino in Las Vegas. This is the largest heist in the casino’s history.

The thieves walked into the casino around 3:00 a.m., armed with guns and pepper spray. They ordered the employees and customers to the ground and started scooping up chips from several tables. They then fled the scene in a waiting SUV.

This is not the first time that the Diamond Casino has been targeted by thieves. In February 2019, two men were caught on camera stealing nearly $200,000 worth of chips.

Casino officials are still investigating the latest robbery and are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.

#  $1M in diamonds and cash stolen during brazen casino robbery

On Thursday morning, a group of armed robbers made off with over $1 million in cash and diamonds from the Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco. The robbery, which took place at around 4:30am, was carried out by four men who entered the casino through a side door armed with pistols and machetes.

The robbers forced their way into the casino's vault, taking several bags containing both cash and diamonds. They then made their escape on foot, leaving behind a scene of chaos and destruction. No one was injured in the robbery, but several casino employees were left traumatized.

This is not the first time that the Casino de Monte Carlo has been targeted by thieves - in 2013, another gang made off with over $2 million worth of jewels. This latest robbery is sure to add to the already considerable security costs at the casino.

It is still unclear how the robbers managed to get past security at the casino, but police are investigating possible links to organized crime syndicates. In Monaco, home of some of the world's most famous casinos, such robberies are unfortunately not uncommon.

#  $5M in diamonds and cash stolen from high-end Vegas casino

On Monday, Feb. 19, a gunman walked into the high-end The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and stole $5 million worth of diamonds and cash from the casino’s safe.

The thief, who has not yet been identified, made his escape through the resort’s main entrance. No one was injured in the robbery.

While it is unclear exactly how much cash was stolen, the diamonds are valued at around $5 million. The theft is said to be one of the largest in Las Vegas history.

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas released a statement following the robbery, saying they were cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation.

“This morning an incident occurred at the casino involving a firearm that resulted in property damage and the theft of property from the safe,” read the statement. “We are fully cooperating with law enforcement on their investigation. The safety and security of our guests and team members is our top priority.”

This is not the first time The Cosmopolitan has been hit by thieves; in December 2017, two men were arrested for stealing $1.5 million worth of jewelry from the resort.

#  Heist at Diamond Casino leaves behind questions about security

On the morning of September 4, thieves made away with a large quantity of diamonds from the Diamond Casino in Las Vegas. Security footage shows three well-dressed individuals entering the casino through the front door and heading to the diamond vault. The suspects then use what appears to be a sledgehammer to break into the vault and make off with several jewels before casually walking out of the casino.

The heist has left many questions unanswered about the security of Diamond Casino. How were the thieves able to get past security? Wasn't there an alarm that was triggered when they broke into the vault? How did they know where the diamonds were stored?

Casino officials are promising a full investigation into what went wrong, but it's clear that there were serious flaws in their security system. This isn't the first time that Diamond Casino has been targeted by thieves - in fact, this is at least the third robbery in as many years.

The Diamond Casino is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, and it's clear that they need to do better when it comes to security. Hopefully, this latest robbery will prompt them to make some changes and ensure that their customers are safe.
