#  What Car Is In Casino Gta Three Card Poker?

The three card poker game is a variation of the casino game poker. It is played with a deck of 36 cards, which consists of three cards of each rank. The objective of the game is to obtain the best possible five-card hand from the three cards that are dealt to the player.

The following are the different hands in ascending order of rank:

Pair: two cards of equal rank.

Two pairs: two different pairs.

Three of a kind: three cards of equal rank.

Straight: five consecutive ranked cards (not all of the same suit).

Flush: all five cards are from the same suit, but not in sequence.

Full house: Three cards of one rank, and two cards of another rank.

Four of a kind: Four cards of equal rank.
Rank higher than four of a kind is a royal flush, which is made up of five suited high cards with an ace as high card. 

In most casinos, the lowest hand that can bet is a pair of kings or higher. In some casinos, there may be a restriction on betting if only two people are playing (ante and play bet), such as no lower than queens. Some casinos also have a rule called "Charlie" or "sticky Charlie". This rule states that if one player has bet and been raised by another, and the first player re-raises again, then the first player can only call or fold; he cannot raise again because it would exceed the maximum number of raises allowed. 

The dealer deals three face-up cards to each player and himself starting from his left, followed by three face-down community cards (the flop). After all players have received their first three cards, there is a betting round beginning with the player to dealer's left and continuing clockwise around the table. At this point in the game each player has two options available - they can either check (place no further wagers but retain their current stake) or they can place a bet equal to twice their ante. Play then proceeds to the next stage after all players have either checked or placed bets - this is when either the fourth community card (turn) is revealed or when all players who have not folded show their hands to determine who has won pots - at which time Ante and Play bets are resolved..
