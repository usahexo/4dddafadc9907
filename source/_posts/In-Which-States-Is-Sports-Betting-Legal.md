#  Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban On Sports Betting

The Supreme Court on Monday invalidated a federal law that barred gambling on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most of the United States, striking down a prohibition that many experts said was no longer relevant in an era of legalized gambling.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority in a 6-3 decision, said the 25-year-old law violated the constitutional principle that states have authority to regulate activities within their borders. He was joined by the court’s four more liberal members.

“The legalization of sports betting requires an important policy choice,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Alito wrote. “Congress can regulate sports betting directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own.”

The law at issue — the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, or Paspa — had blocked all but Nevada from authorizing betting on professional and college sports. Montana and Delaware were exempted because they had preexisting gambling laws affecting only those states.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissent that she would have upheld the federal law. She was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.

#  States Vie To Become Leader In Sports Betting

States across the nation are vying for leadership in the sports betting industry now that the Supreme Court has struck down a federal ban on the activity.

New Jersey, which had been leading the charge to overturn the ban, wasted no time after the ruling was announced Monday to begin taking sports bets. The state's governor, Phil Murphy, placed the first bet himself at Monmouth Park Racetrack, backing the Philadelphia Phillies to beat the Boston Red Sox.

Within hours of the ruling, Delaware also began accepting bets, and Mississippi officials said they would be ready to offer gambling by Friday.

West Virginia is among the states considering whether to quickly pass legislation authorizing sports betting, with discussions already underway about how it would be regulated. "We're open for business," said Kevin Flanagan, a spokesman for West Virginia's lottery commission.

Other states such as New York and California are still studying how best to move forward but are expected to eventually jump into the fray.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that Americans wager about $150 billion illegally on sports each year. The association said it expects that figure to grow rapidly now that states can legalize and regulate sports betting.

"Today's decision provides significant consumer protections and establishes strong regulatory frameworks for gaming in each state," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA. "We applaud Justice Kennedy for recognizing that regulation is better than prohibition."

Some experts believe that Nevada will continue to dominate legal sports betting because of its extensive experience in regulating gambling. But others say other states could eventually eclipse Nevada if they develop good consumer protection policies and create an attractive environment for bookmakers.

#  How Will The Legalization Of Sports Betting Impact Gambling Addiction?

The legalization of sports betting in the United States will likely have a significant impact on gambling addiction rates, as more people will be able to engage in this type of gambling. This will also lead to an increase in the amount of money that is gambled each year, as well as the amount of money that is lost to gambling addiction.

It is estimated that there are currently between 2 and 5 million people in the U.S. who have a gambling addiction. This number is expected to grow significantly after sports betting is legalized. In fact, some experts believe that the number of people with a gambling addiction could jump to as many as 15 million once sports betting is legalized.

There are a number of reasons why the legalization of sports betting will lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. First, it will be much easier for people with a gambling addiction to engage in this type of gambling. Second, there will be more opportunities for people to gamble, as sports betting will be available at casinos and online. Finally, the availability of sports betting will likely lead to an increase in the amount of money that is gambled each year.

The legalization of sports betting is a risky proposition, as it could lead to a significant increase in the number of people with a gambling addiction. However, if it is done correctly, it could also bring significant benefits to states that legalize it.
