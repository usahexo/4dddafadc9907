#  5 Finger Poker – How Many Hands Can You Make? 

In 5 finger poker, players are dealt five cards, one at a time. After the first card is dealt, the player has the option to discard and draw again. Once all five cards are dealt, the player arranges them into any five-card poker hand they can make and bets accordingly.

The ranking of hands in ascending order is as follows: high card, pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush. If two or more players have the same hand, the pot is split equally between them. 

A wild card can be used to represent any other card in the deck to make a better hand. For example, if you are dealt 2♥ 3♣ 4♦ 7♣ and there is a joker in the deck, then you have two possible hands: 2♥ 3♣ 4♦ 7♣ (a pair of sevens) or 2♥ 3♣ 4♦ 7♦ (three of a kind). 

There are 1358 different possible 5-card hands in 5-finger poker. This number comes from multiplying 52 (the number of cards in a deck) by 2 (the number of potential suits for each card) by 3 (the number of potential rank values for each suit). 

Here are some of the most common hands: 



Of course, there are many other possibilities as well. The best way to learn about these is to practice and see which ones come up most often for you.
